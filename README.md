## Scenario:

We have been tasked with exploring data on movies to identify revenue trends and potential correlations with various actors, genres, release windows, etc. with the ultimate goal of picking the right ingredients to make a successful movie.

## Factors We Intend to Investigate:
1. Movie revenue by release month
2. Movie genre revenue by release month
3. Revenue by genre
4. Initial investment vs revenue (ROI calculation)
5. Actors' correlation to a movie's success
6. Directors' correlation to movie's success
7. Franchise or comic-based movies revenue performance vs non-franchise movies 
8. Movie rating's correlation to revenue
